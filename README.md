# sql-challenge
Armando Cota's submission for SQL assignment


In this challenge we were given starter code that contained 6 different csv files. The assignment was to data engineer and data analyze the files so that they may be presented 
in a professional manner for a company name Pewlett Hackard. Within this repo you will find a folder name code_folder, within will be two sql files that establish not only tables 
that have the provided csv files imported into them, but also an analysis based on the parameters given to the students. There is also a png file that shows a diagram of how I wanted to connect all of my tables together through primary keys and foreign keys. 

***NOTICE***
I was running into some problems with pgadmin4 with importing my csvfiles into my tables. So, with the help of stack overflow and my tutor I was able to implement the files into my
tables via vscode. Not only was the data able to import successfully, but I found the interface through vscode was much more efficient when it came to interacting with my tables. 
Enjoy the assignment code that I have completed here. I am quite excited with the final outcome!
